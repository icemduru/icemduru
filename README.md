### Hi, I am Ilhan Cem Duru ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸ”­ About Me (Scientist Me)
- I am a postdoctoral research scientist at University of Helsinki.

- My expertise is cracking the code of tiny life forms. (Genomic and transciptomic data analysis of bacteria and viruses). However,  I have also worked with data from human, seal, and butterfly.

- Currently, I am involved in several projects with a primary focus on **population genomics for silver birch tree breeding**. We aim to create genomic prediction models for silver birch tree breeding. The model will help to improve breeding efficiency of silver birch trees.

- I love creating interactive web browser-based visualizations for my scientific data. For example;
  - [Web genome viewer of Listeria](https://icemduru.github.io/listeria_ro15_transcript/)
  - [Gene network of Listeria](https://icemduru.github.io/RO15_gene_network/#/)

- Do you need to trim adapter+barcode sequences from your Pacbio HiFi reads ?
  - Then, you can utilize my Python-based bioinformatics tool [HiFiAdapterTrimmer](https://github.com/icemduru/HiFiAdapterTrimmer)

- Feel free to explore my scientific papers on my [Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2PvKi2YAAAAJ&hl)


### ðŸ’» About Me (Tech Enthusiast Me)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Full Stack development via [FullStackOpen](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course. Follow my progress, and check my exercises at [my exercises github repository](https://github.com/icemduru/fullstackopen_exercises) dedicated to exercises.

- ðŸ“Š Machine learning and data science are my passions. I enjoy sharpening my skills on the [Kaggle platform](https://www.kaggle.com/), where I participate in various competitions. You can see my achievements on [my Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/cemduru/competitions?tab=completed)

- I have completed Data Scientist Career Path at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/icemduru/certificates/5b520caa1d176d21f5a65a61). Where I learned:
  - How to acquire, manipulate, wrangle, and tidy data using SQL and Python.
  - How to visualize data using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.
  - How to analyze data using pandas, numpy, scipy, and statsmodels.
  - How to design experiments and test hypotheses using inferential statistics and causal inference.
  - How to build and evaluate machine learning and deep learning models using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.
  - Check my codecademy exercises at [my codecademy exercises github repository](https://github.com/icemduru/my_codecademy_exercises).

- Iâ€™m also interested in cloud computing. In fact, I have recently earned the [Azure AI Fundamentals certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/3a9454bc-77e4-42ca-bc71-3e66805b74d5).
