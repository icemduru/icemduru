### Hi I am Ilhan Cem Duru ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸ”­ About Me (Scientist Me)
- I am a postdoctoral reseach scientist at University of Helsinki.

- My expertise is cracking the code of tiny life forms. (Genomic and transciptomic data analysis of bacteria and viruses). However,  I have also handled data from human, seal, and butterfly.

- I am currently working on several different projects, but the main one is **population genomics for silver birch tree breeding**. We aim to create genomic prediction models for silver birch tree breeding. The model will help to improve breeding efficiency of silver birch trees.

- I love creating interactive web browser based visualizations for my scientific data. For example;
  - [Web genome viewer of Listeria](https://icemduru.github.io/listeria_ro15_transcript/)
  - [Gene network of Listeria](https://icemduru.github.io/RO15_gene_network/#/)

- Do you need to trim adapter+barcode sequences from your Pacbio HiFi reads ?
  - Then, use my python based bioinformatics tool [HiFiAdapterTrimmer](https://github.com/icemduru/HiFiAdapterTrimmer)
